        <h1>Domain Adaptation and Image Scene Classification using ML Techniques</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p><font color="brown">The domain adaptation (DA) approaches available to date are usually not well suited for practical DA scenarios of remote sensing image classification, since these methods rely on rich prior knowledge about the relationship between label sets of source and target domains, and source data are often not accessible due to privacy or confidentiality issues. To this end, we propose a practical universal domain
            adaptation setting for remote sensing image scene classification that requires no prior knowledge on the label sets</font></p>
