    <h1>Fingerprint Based car ignition system using Arduino</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p><font color="brown">This effort focuses on keeping autos safe from unwanted usage and preventing theft. Only approved individuals can start the
        vehicle using a biometric fingerprint security system. This protects the car. The use of security systems is expanding and is becoming
        increasingly required around the world. Biometrics such as fingerprints are commonly employed in factories, buildings, and schools. This
        project is concerned with vehicle security, which leads to the development of an anti-theft system in a car using the ATmega328. To detect
        the fingerprint, an inside-the-vehicle fingerprint sensor is used. The fingerprint sensor data reading obtained in the ATmega328 is analyzed
        using the pre-assigned data. The engine ignition system starts after recognizing the person as the car owner or an authorized fingerprint
        user who can take control of the car. If an intruder is present, the engine will not start. Other security systems can be hacked, whereas in
        this case, a fingerprint is used as the key, which is unique to each individual and thus provides improved security.</font></p>
